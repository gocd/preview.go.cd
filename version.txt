        Revert "Force test-drive to run under Rosetta/x64 on Apple Silicon"
        
        This reverts commit fd7b04be915fad5c1ffaee3ddff2019d37c557fe. Was deemed to be unnecessary. If the user doesn't have Rosetta 2 installed, the same error will be yielded in either case.
        
        Would be better to replace this with proper arm builds of the test-drive/trial launcher
