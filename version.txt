        Reduce hard prerequisites of try.sh
        
        - Removes dependency on `grep`
        - Fully checks for non-bash-builtin prerequisites
        - Also, try our best to verify the SHA, even falling back
          to openssl
            - If no way to verify, just print a warning and carry on
